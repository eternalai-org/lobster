# The open source OpenClaw hardware device

[Lobster](https://eternalai.org/lobster) is an easy, affordable, and fun way to set up OpenClaw at home. 

Lobster upgrades your OpenClaw setup with a dedicated hardware device:

- **🔌 Plug & play:** Plug in, connect WiFi, then talk to it — it's that easy
- **🕓 24/7:** It has its own computer and always run
- **🛡️ Secure by design:** It has its own browser & file systems and never touches yours
- **🔒 Private by default:** Your data never leaves your Lobster device

OpenClaw runs on Lobster, so you get all the things you love about OpenClaw:

- **📱 Any chat app:** Talk to it on WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, or iMessage
- **🧠 Persistent memory:** It remembers your conversations and becomes uniquely yours
- **🧩 Skills & plugins:** Extend with community skills or build your own
- **💪 AI that actually does things:** Clears your inbox, sends emails, manages your calendar, checks you in for flights
