# The open source OpenClaw hardware device

[Lobster](https://eternalai.org/lobster) is an easy, affordable, and fun way to set up OpenClaw at home.

Lobster upgrades your OpenClaw setup with a dedicated hardware device:

- **🔌 Plug & play:** Plug in, connect WiFi, then talk to it — it's that easy

## DIY

Lobster is open source. If you know the terminal and have a 3D printer, it is a fun weekend project!

1. 3D Print Lobster: [3MF](lobster.3mf), [STL](lobster.stl) 
2. Buy a [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/)
3. Connect Raspberry Pi 5 to a [network](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#networking)
4. Install [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/)
5. Set up OpenClaw [personal asssistant](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/openclaw)

## Buy the kit

If you don't want to do it yourself, the easiest way is to buy a Lobster [on our site](https://eternalai.org/lobster).

It's pre-installed and pre-configured so it works out of the box.

## Plug and play

Get Lobster up and running in minutes.

Plug it in, connect it to WiFi, then talk to it on Telegram, Whatsapp, Discord, Slack or iMessage — it's that easy.

## Private

Lobster is private by default. 

Unlike running OpenClaw on a cloud service, your data is not stored on a 3rd-party server but stored locally on your Lobster.

Lobster is secure by design.

It has its own computer, its browser to browse the web, and its own file system to run shell commands.
