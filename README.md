# Lobster: The Open Source Agentic Computer

## The OpenClaw hardware device

We ❤️ OpenClaw. But no easy way exists to run OpenClaw safely. So we built [Lobster](https://eternalai.org/lobster) —  a beautiful, affordable, and secure device to run OpenClaw at home (and at work too!).

**Why Lobster?**

Running OpenClaw on cloud services means your data lives on someone else's server. Running OpenClaw on your personal computer means OpenClaw has access to your browser and files — that's a security risk. 

Lobster is the best of both worlds. It's a dedicated computer for OpenClaw — with its own browser and file system. Your data stays private. Your personal computer stays safe.

**Lobster upgrades your OpenClaw setup with a dedicated hardware device:**

- 🔌 Plug & play: Plug in, connect WiFi, then talk to it — it's that easy
- 🕓 24/7: It has its own computer and always runs
- 🛡️ Secure by design: It has its own browser & file systems and never touches yours
- 🔒 Private by default: Your data never leaves your Lobster device

**OpenClaw runs on Lobster, so you get all the things you love about OpenClaw:**

- 📱 Any chat app: Talk to it on WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, or iMessage
- 🧠 Persistent memory: It remembers your conversations and becomes uniquely yours
- 🧩 Skills & plugins: Extend with community skills or build your own
- 💪 AI that actually does things: Handles your emails, manages your calendar, checks in flights

## DIY

Lobster is open source. If you know the terminal and have a 3D printer, it is a fun weekend project!

1. 3D Print Lobster: [3MF](lobster.3mf), [STL](lobster.stl) 
2. Buy a [Raspberry Pi 5](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/raspberry-pi-5/)
3. Buy microSD card and USB-C power adapter 
4. Connect Raspberry Pi 5 to a [network](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/configuration.html#networking)
5. Install [OpenClaw](https://openclaw.ai/)
5. Set up OpenClaw [personal assistant](https://docs.openclaw.ai/start/openclaw)

## Buy the kit

If you don't want to do it yourself, the easiest way is to buy a Lobster [on our site](https://eternalai.org/lobster).

It's pre-installed and pre-configured so it works out of the box.

## Plug and play

Get Lobster up and running in minutes.

Plug it in, connect it to WiFi, then talk to it on Telegram, Whatsapp, Discord, Slack or iMessage — it's that easy.

## Private

Lobster is private by default. 

Unlike running OpenClaw on a cloud service, your data is not stored on a 3rd-party server but stored locally on your Lobster.

## Secure

Lobster is secure by design.

It has its own computer, its browser to browse the web, and its own file system to run shell commands. It never touches your computer and your data.

## Specs

For beginners, we recommend to start with Raspberry Pi 5. 

- **CPU:** Broadcom BCM2712 2.4GHz quad-core 64-bit Arm Cortex-A76
- **RAM:** 8GB LPDDR4X-4267
- **Storage:** 128GB microSD
- **Connectivity:** Wi-Fi 5, Bluetooth 5.0
- **Power:** 5V/5A DC power via USB-C

For advanced users, we recommend to build a dedicated Nvidia box that can run local AI inferences for total privacy. 

- **GPU:** 2-4 x 5090
- **RAM:** 256-512 GB
- **Disk:** 1 TB

At Eternal AI, we set up our own Nvidia boxes. Happy to open source our Nvidia box setup too if there is enough interest.
